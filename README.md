Bringing digital attendance to rural schools — fast, secure, and easy for teachers, parents, and students.
Project Overview
Overview:

The Automated Attendance System is designed to make attendance tracking accurate, simple, and accessible for rural schools.
It helps teachers, parents, and school administrators monitor student attendance in real-time, reducing manual errors and improving accountability.
This system combines modern technology with practical rural requirements, ensuring schools with limited resources can maintain efficient attendance management.

Solution:

We provide a smart attendance system that combines:
Face Recognition & Biometric Verification for high accuracy
Offline-first web architecture for areas with poor internet
SMS/IVR notifications to parents
Teacher-friendly dashboards with auto-generated reports
Multi-language support for inclusivity

Key Innovations & Unique Features:
Face Recognition & Biometric Attendance: Ensures high accuracy in student tracking.
Offline-First Architecture: Works seamlessly in rural areas with poor or no internet.
SMS/IVR Notifications: Parents receive real-time attendance alerts.
Teacher-Friendly Dashboard: Auto-generated reports for easy attendance management.
Multi-Language Support: Promotes inclusivity for all students and teachers.
Government Database Integration: Smooth integration with official school records.
